# Plum

Plum is a Monte Carlo simulation package for polymers. Currently, Plum contains the following features:
* Bulk and z-direction confined simulations.
* Grand-canonical ensemble simulation.
* Configurational-bias chain insertion and deletion.
* Ewald summation for electrostatics calculations.
* Allowing arbitrary surface charged site and Lennard-Jones site arrangements.
* Every monomer/bead can be assigned its own charge and Lennard-Jones parameters.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
