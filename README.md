# Plum

Plum is a Monte Carlo simulation package for polymers. The main features of Plum are:
* Ewald summation for electrostatics calculations.
* Arbitrary surface charged site and Lennard-Jones site arrangements in confined simulations.
* Every monomer/bead can be assigned its own charge and Lennard-Jones parameters.

Plum also contains the following special features:
* Grand-canonical ensemble simulation with configurational-bias chain insertion and deletion.
* Confined simulations.(periodic only along x and y directions)
  * dsdfdddddd
* Osmotic pressure calculations for both bulk and confined systems.

Last, we would like to implement the following features in Plum in the future:
* The routines to simulate arbitrarily branched polymers.
* The routines for calculating angle and dihedral angle energies and forces.
* The routines to handle arbitrarily grafted polymers on the confining plates.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
